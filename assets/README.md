# 2023-2025Tomato cucumber dataset

## Data set introduction

Data were collected using Aerospace Huachuang ( camera, environmental monitoring ), Topcloud ( biological data ), and manual collection.

The plant number is used for index, and each plant number is a three-digit number, corresponding to the treatment method, the plant variety and the plant number under the same treatment method. For example, Number 213 represents the plant for the No. 2 fertilization scheme, the third plant of No.2 variety.

The list of all the numbers of plants in 2023 is as follows.

### Photo file

All image files are under the Images folder, and the folder is named according to the plant number of the first row and the third column of the first row of the image, separated by ', '.

```javascript
202505\images
├─11,411
├─111,211
```
The files under the folder such as 11,411 are named as the time stamp of the shooting time, which corresponds to the Photo Path column in the files such as 20250501.csv.
```javascript

### Fertilizer application scheme

Based on the formula of Japanese Yamazaki nutrient solution ( tomato ), the experiment was carried out. The specific scheme is as follows. After planting, fertilizer was applied once every 15 days. The amount of fertilizer applied in each treatment was taken as an example : KH ~ 2 ~ PO ~ 4 ~ 27.2 g, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>52.3g,CaCl <sub>2</sub>44.4g.
